For a while I had been dreaming about creating a [Blame!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!) inspired game. **Blame!'s** environment and others like it have been described as indifferent to the people (or other creatures) that inhabit it. The environments are often megastructures, built for purposes other than housing life. But when developing games, we often build our environments to suit the traversal needs of our protagonists. There cannot be any dead ends that softlock you after 10 minutes of playtime. How do you manage to build a game that feels hostile, while keeping an engaging player experience?

## Exploration without failstates

I'm creating a game under the working name "Don't blame yourself too much" (DBYTM). It is a 3D exploration-platformer that takes place at the end of the universe, right before its heat death, just before the last star burns out. The game takes place in a world very much inspired by Tsutomu Nihei's work, a megastructure being expanded by automata. The story follows Cece and Mur, two siblings searching for an observatory.

Today we will be looking into how you control Cece and Mur as you explore this world. I want to create a seamless experience without fail states, while giving the player as much freedom to explore as possible. Let's build up to the core traversal design idea.

Cece is the primary character you will be controlling. She controls much like other protagonists from platformers. She can walk around, run and jump. Most importantly, she is only impeded by the collision geometry of the world. She is able to walk off cliffs and jump up to higher platforms. Let's look at a scene that represents the game world and possible traversal problems you could run into.

Cece is represented by the red bean. You can imagine walking down that slope and wanting to explore the surrounding area.

You could jump off to a lower platform (1). Or try to make the jump (2). Maybe you just want to see what's down below (3). These 3 actions are troublesome. If you jump off at (1), then you can't get back up unless there are some platforms to get you back up. If this is an inhospitable area of the game, then this might not make sense. Those platforms might look a bit too convenient to the player, resulting in the breaking of their suspension of disbelief. What if you fail jump (2)? Do we just magically teleport the player back? Do we kill Cece?! These things are expected from games, we can call them fail states. And most would not mind. But what if we could let the player just fall? What will they find there? Not sure, probably an empty surface.

For now let's focus on the solution. We introduce Mur. While Cece is controlled with your typical WASD + SPACEBAR combo, Mur is controlled RTS style with the click of a mouse button. Where Cece's movement is constrained by the environment's collision geometry, Mur's movement is decided entirely by a navmesh. He is stuck on it.

This means that there is no way for him to get stuck somewhere, as long as the navmesh is continuous. There are some details that I will skip for now, especially with the puzzles in mind. But he is our anchor. He is our savepoint. Let's take a look at his playing field.

Mur is represented by the green bean and his navmesh is the area surrounded by green. We can clearly see that he can freely walk around the area after exiting the hallway. Mur and Cece are a clever pair. They each have half of a tool: a teleportation device that lets one wearer teleport to the other. I assume you understand the implications. Cece can, at any moment, teleport to Mur's location (represented by the red arrows). 

This unlocks a new level of freedom for Cece's movement. Since our progress is tracked by Mur's position in the world, we can explore every corner of every environment we find ourselves in. This has its drawbacks. Creating puzzles with this mechanic in mind is trickyâ€”at some point we might want to take away Cece's powers. But I won't focus too much on the problems in this post.

There is one last problem to solve: if the navmesh has to be continuous, then realistically Cece could also just walk anywhere, defeating the purpose of any platforming challenge. Unless a switch for a door was unreachable, which is a decent solution. To address this, I also introduce conditional teleportation for Mur.

There are objects in the game (represented by the purple blob) where Cece can summon Mur. This lets Mur move to places he couldn't otherwise reach.

This system lies at the core of DBYTM's identity. It makes it so that you can have a lot of awkward space that the player is encouraged to explore. Because they can always teleport back to their anchor, their checkpoint (Mur). It comes with it's own design challenges. But as the good old saying goes: limitation breeds creativity. And I think this system achieves just that.
