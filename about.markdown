Hi, I'm Dmitry Buggenhout,


I am not yet comfortable labeling myself as an expert on any of the crafts I am able to perform. I feel like a generalists that loves telling stories, building worlds and designing game systems. By trade, I am a software developer focused on back end systems and performance.

I hope you find some interesting reads here.
