Hi, I'm Dmitry Buggenhout.

I am obsessed with the act of creation. I am captivated by the art we make, whether it be painting, poems, books, manga, sculpting, games, anime, movies ...
I don't discriminate, I enjoy consuming these things and love picking them apart. Looking for experiences.

I have a need to create. In my life, I have had the pleasure to play the guitar, dance, write, sculpt (3D software), film, make games and more.
I love to enterain. And I deeply love making people think.

I am making games, mostly as a designer and programmer.
